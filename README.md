You can feel free to add this to your blocking software like Pi-Hole or otherwise. You should only do so if you know what you are doing, and if you can undo potential damage involved. I am not responsible for any damage that you cause by misimplemnting this blocklist. 

All credit goes to the Awake Security team. I do not intend to profit from this and have only done this out of goodwill for the community.
