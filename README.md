> :warning:**DO NOT VISIT ANY OF THE DOMAINS IN THIS BLOCKLIST UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.** :warning:

All credit goes to the Awake Security team. I do not intend to profit from this and have only done this out of goodwill for the community.

Their pdf report is also uploaded in this repo. 

Original list can be found in tabbed format here: https://awakesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/GalComm-Registered-Domains-List-Appendix-A.txt.
It is also uploaded in this repo. 

Modifications performed to the TSV were: 

- Stripped Category names off
- Added 0.0.0.0 to comply with HOSTS format

You can feel free to add this to your blocking software like Pi-Hole or otherwise. You should only do so if you know what you are doing, and if you can undo potential damage involved. I am not responsible for any damage that you cause by misimplemnting this blocklist. I am also not responsible for any damage that you cause by visiting any of the domains in the blocklist. 

**Future updates**: I do not anticipate updating this list in the future, unless a substantial update is released by the Awake Security team. Treat this list as-is. Hopefully it will be incorporated into bigger blocklists in the future.
